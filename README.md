POC of component testing implemenation for the playwright.

Moved source code from a personal repo just for demo reason. Don't try to use it yet.

Maybe a better approach will be provided by Playwright maintainers. Tracking issue: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/7148. Now awaiting for feedback.

# Test 

`npm test`

# playwright-module-loader
